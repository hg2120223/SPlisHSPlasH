# VolumeSampling

The simulators can load particle data from partio files. This particle data then defines the initial configuration of the particles in the simulation. The VolumeSampling tool allows you to sample a volumetric object with particle data. This means you can load an OBJ file with a closed surface geometry and sample the interior with particles.
